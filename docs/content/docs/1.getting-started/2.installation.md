# Installation
::lead-p
`serversideup/php` is compatible with any container orchestrator that supports Docker images (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, HashiCorp Nomad, etc.).
::

::lead-p
All images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php)  for free. Containers default to running Debian, but Alpine images are also available.
::

## What's Docker?
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open source utility for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are isolated environments that can run on any host.

### Why containerize with Docker?
Going through the efforts of containerizing your application gives you one extremely powerful capability:

üëâ **You can run your application anywhere**

Once you're at this level, you unlock a ton of new possibilities:

- **Your application runs the same, everywhere** - no more "it works on my machine". Run 100% of your application on any operating system. All they need is Docker installed.
- **Ship with more confidence** - all infrastructure configurations are *centrally managed* in Git, so you can change, test and rollback with ease
- **No more vendor lock-in** - if a host raises their prices on you, you can migrate with very little effort
- **Scaling is a breeze** - once you get your application in one container, it's so easy to scale up to any number of containers
- **Improved security** - containerized apps are more secure than traditional apps because they are isolated from the host
- **Better uptime** - if something fails during deployment, you can roll back your application to a previous version with ease

The even crazier part is you don't need a Platform as a Service (PaaS) to get all these benefits. Everything can be done with 100% free and open source tools.

## How to get started with Docker
At first, Docker may seem a little intimidating, but don't let that stop you. Docker is one of the most powerful skill-sets that we've learned in our career.

Although teaching you how to use Docker is beyond the scope of serversideup/php, we've actually created another open source project called [Spin](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/) that dramatically reduces the learning curve for getting started with Docker.

Here's a quick demo of Spin of what an app looks like when we use Docker from development to production:

## Our most popular images
All images are intelligently tagged with the PHP version and variation. This allows you to easily select the right image for your use case. 

If you do not specify a variation, it will default to `cli` and the latest supported Debian release for that variation.

Our most popular tags include:

## Selecting the right variation
We offer a number of different variations to suit your needs. Each variation is optimized for specific use cases.

### CLI
The CLI variation is a minimal image designed for running PHP from the command line only. It does not include a web server.

Use this variation for running commands like Composer, running scheduled tasks, or executing PHP scripts that don't require a web server.

[Learn more about CLI ‚Üí](/docs/image-variations/cli)

### FPM
The FPM (Fast Process Manager) variation runs PHP-FPM without a web server. This variation is ideal for microservices architectures where you need a dedicated PHP backend.

Use this variation when you already have a separate proxy or load balancer handling static content and routing PHP requests to your FPM container. This is commonly used in larger-scale deployments.

[Learn more about FPM ‚Üí](/docs/image-variations/fpm)

### FPM-Apache
The FPM-Apache variation combines PHP-FPM with Apache as a reverse proxy. Apache serves static content directly and forwards PHP requests to PHP-FPM for processing.

Use this variation for applications like WordPress that benefit from Apache's .htaccess support and mod_rewrite functionality. This is a production-ready setup using S6 Overlay to manage both processes reliably.

[Learn more about FPM-Apache ‚Üí](/docs/image-variations/fpm-apache) | [Using Docker with WordPress ‚Üí](/docs/guide/using-wordpress-with-docker)

### FPM-NGINX
The FPM-NGINX variation combines PHP-FPM with NGINX as a reverse proxy. This is the traditional setup that has been widely adopted for modern PHP applications, including many Laravel deployments.

Use this variation for production Laravel applications and other PHP frameworks that require a stable, battle-tested web server configuration. We use S6 Overlay to ensure both processes run reliably in a single container.

[Learn more about FPM-NGINX ‚Üí](/docs/image-variations/fpm-nginx)

### Unit (deprecated)
::note
In October 2025, NGINX stopped supporting NGINX Unit and archived the project. NGINX Unit will eventually be removed from our project. [See the official announcement ‚Üí](https://github.com/nginx/unit?tab=readme-ov-file#nginx-unit)
::

The Unit variation uses NGINX Unit as a modern application server that runs everything in a single process.

While this variation is being deprecated, it can still be used for existing applications. Consider migrating to FrankenPHP for a modern single-process alternative.

[Learn more about Unit ‚Üí](/docs/image-variations/unit)

### FrankenPHP
The FrankenPHP variation is a modern application server built on top of the Caddy web server. It runs everything in a single process, eliminating the complexity of managing PHP-FPM and a separate web server.

Use this variation for Laravel or Symfony applications that can benefit from worker mode, automatic HTTPS, and modern protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. This is the recommended variation for new projects seeking cutting-edge performance.

[Learn more about FrankenPHP ‚Üí](/docs/image-variations/frankenphp)

## Selecting the version of PHP
Selecting the best version of PHP is highly dependent on your use case. In a perfect world, running the latest version of PHP will give you the latest and greatest, but it all depends on the libraries that your application uses.

For example, if you're running a WordPress site with a ton of different plugins, they may be using libraries that do not yet support the latest version of PHP. Be sure to evaluate your dependencies and test your application before deploying to production.

All versions + variations are tagged by:
- Major Version (example: `8` will give you the latest 8.x version)
- Minor Version (example: `8.3` will give you the latest 8.3.x version)
- Patch Version (example: `8.3.2` will always stay at the 8.3.2 version)

If you use `latest`, you will always get the latest stable version of the CLI variation of PHP running the latest version of Debian. For the best stability in production environments, you may want to pin to a specific patch version (example: `8.3.2`).

### Few examples

::code-panel
---
label: Latest version of 8.3.x running FPM + NGINX from GitHub Packages
---
```bash

```
::

::code-panel
---

---
```bash
serversideup/php:8.1.16-fpm-apache-alpine-v3.0.0
```
::

In this example, we can lock into the `v3.0.0` release of our image. This is useful if you want to ensure there are no automatic changes that could break your CI process. [View our releases ‚Üí](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/releases)

## Viewing all available images & tags
All our images are available on DockerHub and GitHub Packages (ghcr.io). You can use their built-in search functions to browse through our entire collection of Docker Images:

- [View on GitHub Packages ‚Üí](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php)

## Downloading an image
In the simplest form of using the image, you can simply pull it down.

::code-panel
---
label: Pull an image with Docker
---
```bash
docker pull serversideup/php:8.3-fpm-nginx
```
::

If you'd like to explore the image a little bit more, you can run `bash` on the image and view the structure of everything.

## Running with a container orchestrator
`serversideup/php` is compatible with any container orchestrator that supports Docker images. Learn more below on how to use this image with the orchestrator of your choice.
