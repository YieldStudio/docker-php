::lead-p
We're taking the extra effort to open source as much as we can. Not only could this potentially help someone learn a little bit of Docker, but it makes it a *heck of a lot* easier for us to work with other people on our other open source projects.

## Special thanks
This project wouldn't be possible without the help of some amazing people. We're grateful for their support and contributions. We wanted to give them a special shoutout here (in no particular order).

### [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper){target="_blank"}
Majority of our knowledge came from Chris' course, [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker). If you have yet to discover his content, you will be very satisfied with every course he has to offer. He's a great human being and excellent educator. Chris has continuously provided quality feedback that has deeply inspired the direction of this project.

### [Joel Clermont](https://github.com/joelclermont/){target="_blank"}
Joel is one of the friendliest people that you'll ever meet. When he's not podcasting on his own show, [No Compromises](https://show.nocompromises.io/), he's busy helping other people in the PHP community. Joel's deep experience with PHP is rare to find, and we're grateful that we were able to pick his brain to bring you the best PHP Docker experience possible.

### [Patricio](https://github.com/ijpatricio){target="_blank"}
If there's a new framework or tool in the web development world, Patricio probably has content for it on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PatricioOnCode). Patricio is a great resource for all things web development. Frontend, backend, DevOps -- it doesn't matter. Patricio graciously shared his wide spectrum of experiences with us and is a huge supporter of this project.
