`serversideup/php` is compatible with any container orchestrator that supports Docker images (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, HashiCorp Nomad, etc.). All images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php)  for free. Containers default to running Debian, but Alpine images are also available.

## Understanding containers and Docker

If you're new to Docker or containers, you might be wondering why you should containerize your application in the first place. The short answer: **containers let you run your application anywhere** — from your laptop to any cloud provider — with zero changes.

Key benefits of containerization:
- **Consistency** - Your app runs the same on Mac, Windows, Linux, and production
- **Confidence** - Infrastructure as code means easier testing and rollbacks
- **Freedom** - No vendor lock-in; migrate hosts with minimal effort
- **Simplicity** - Scaling from 1 to 100 containers is straightforward

There are some important terms to understand when working with containers:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Container | A running instance of an image. |
| Image | A template for a container to start with (like serversideup/php). |
| Registry | A repository of images. This is where users can pull images from to start a container. This can be places like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php) or [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php). |

If you'd like to learn more about containers, you can learn more following the guide below.

## Quick Start
In order to run containers, we need a container engine installed such as Docker. You can follow [ Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to get started. Confirm Docker is working by running these commands in your terminal:
```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose version
docker compose version
```

If you see the version numbers, you're ready to go!

### Create a new sample project
Let's create a new sample project to test our Docker setup.

```bash
# Create a new directory for our project
mkdir my-php-project

# Change directory to our project
cd my-php-project

# Create a public directory for our "public facing" files
mkdir public
```

Once we're in our project directory, we will want to create two files:

1. `public/index.php` - The file that will be served when someone visits our site
1. `compose.yml` - The place where we will put our configuration files

The content of these files should look like:

::code-tree{defaultValue="public/index.php"}

```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    # Choose our PHP version and variation
    image: serversideup/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
    # Expose localhost:80 to NGINX's port 8080
    ports:
      - 80:8080
    # Mount current directory to /var/www/html
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
```

```php [public/index.php]
<?php
// Let's just print out some PHP info
phpinfo();
?>
```
::

Save these files and ensure they are in the exact structure above.

### Bringing up your PHP app
From your project root directory, run the following command to start your PHP app:

::warning
Make sure you are running the following commands from your **project root directory** (`my-php-project`). If you do not have `compose.yml` in the same directory as you run this command, the command will not work. Also, make sure you don't have any other containers or services that are currently running on port 80. If you do, you will need to stop them before running the following command.
::

```bash
docker compose up
```

You'll see the logs appear in your terminal. **Keep your terminal open** as we'll need it to control the container.

### Viewing your PHP app
To view your PHP app, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the PHP info page:

![PHP Info Page](images/docs/php-info.png)

### Stopping your application
To stop the container, press :kbd{value="ctrl"} + :kbd{value="C"} on the original terminal window or you can run the following command from your project root directory:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Congratulations! You ran your first containerized PHP app!
Now that you've successfully run your first PHP app with Docker, let's learn how to select the right image for your use case. The true power of containers is when you can change your PHP version and/or variation by changing a single line in your configuration file.
