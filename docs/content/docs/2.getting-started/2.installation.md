# Installation
::lead-p
`serversideup/php` is compatible with any container orchestrator that supports Docker images (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, HashiCorp Nomad, etc.).
::

::lead-p
All images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php)  for free. Containers default to running Debian, but Alpine images are also available.
::

## What's Docker?
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open source utility for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are isolated environments that can run on any host.

### Why containerize with Docker?
Going through the efforts of containerizing your application gives you one extremely powerful capability:

üëâ **You can run your application anywhere**

Once you're at this level, you unlock a ton of new possibilities:

- **Your application runs the same, everywhere** - no more "it works on my machine". Run 100% of your application on any operating system. All they need is Docker installed.
- **Ship with more confidence** - all infrastructure configurations are *centrally managed* in Git, so you can change, test and rollback with ease
- **No more vendor lock-in** - if a host raises their prices on you, you can migrate with very little effort
- **Scaling is a breeze** - once you get your application in one container, it's so easy to scale up to any number of containers
- **Improved security** - containerized apps are more secure than traditional apps because they are isolated from the host
- **Better uptime** - if something fails during deployment, you can roll back your application to a previous version with ease

The even crazier part is you don't need a Platform as a Service (PaaS) to get all these benefits. Everything can be done with 100% free and open source tools.

## How to get started with Docker
At first, Docker may seem a little intimidating, but don't let that stop you. Docker is one of the most powerful skill-sets that we've learned in our career.

Although teaching you how to use Docker is beyond the scope of serversideup/php, we've actually created another open source project called [Spin](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/) that dramatically reduces the learning curve for getting started with Docker.

Here's a quick demo of Spin of what an app looks like when we use Docker from development to production:

## Our most popular images
All images are intelligently tagged with the PHP version and variation. This allows you to easily select the right image for your use case. 

If you do not specify a variation, it will default to `cli` and the latest supported Debian release for that variation.

Our most popular tags include:

## Selecting the right variation
There are 4 main variations.

### CLI
If you need to run a quick command with something like `composer` or use PHP to run a CLI program only, this might be a great option for you.

### FPM
The `fpm` variation is great for people who need to run a PHP "backend" if they already have a proxy serving static content. If you're using FPM only, that means you're probably at a larger scale.

### FPM-Apache
The `fpm-apache` variation is meant for users who want to run something like WordPress with Docker. Apache is configured to be a "reverse proxy", which will serve any static content with Apache and serve any PHP requests with PHP-FPM. Since there are two processes required to run this variation, we use [S6 Overlay](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay) to ensure the container health is accurate.

[Learn more about using Docker with WordPress ‚Üí](/docs/guide/using-wordpress-with-docker)

### FPM-NGINX
Over the last 15+ years `fpm-nginx` has been "the way" to run PHP web applications, including Laravel. Since around 2010, it's been adopted and trusted by some of the best PHP system administrators out there. As of 2025, we're starting to see other options like FrankenPHP push the industry forward, but `fpm-nginx` is very stable and still widely used today.

The only caveat with running FPM + NGINX together with Docker is it requires two processes (which can lead to strange container behaviors). Thankfully, we took this all in mind with our design by using 's been trusted and deployed millions of times and there's a large adoption This allows you to serve static content quickly with NGINX but also pass PHP requests to PHP-FPM. Similar to PHP-Apache, there are two processes required to run this variation. We use S6 Overlay to ensure the container health is accurate.

[Learn more about S6 Overlay ‚Üí](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay)

### Unit (deprecated)
::note
In October 2025, NGINX stopped supporting NGINX Unit and archived the project. NGINX Unit will eventually be removed from our project. [See the official announcement ‚Üí](https://github.com/nginx/unit?tab=readme-ov-file#nginx-unit)
::

The `unit` variation is for NGINX Unit, which is a NGINX's modern approach to delivering containerized web applications.
[Learn more about Unit ‚Üí](https://unit.nginx.org/)

### FrankenPHP

The `frankenphp` variation is a modern application server for PHP built on top of the Caddy web server. Instead of relying on the complexities of two processes running NGINX + PHP-FPM, FrankenPHP replaces both to run everything under one process. FrankenPHP supports worker mode for Laravel and Symfony applications, automatic HTTPS, and modern protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

## Selecting the version of PHP
Selecting the best version of PHP is highly dependent on your use case. In a perfect world, running the latest version of PHP will give you the latest and greatest, but it all depends on the libraries that your application uses.

For example, if you're running a WordPress site with a ton of different plugins, they may be using libraries that do not yet support the latest version of PHP. Be sure to evaluate your dependencies and test your application before deploying to production.

All versions + variations are tagged by:
- Major Version (example: `8` will give you the latest 8.x version)
- Minor Version (example: `8.3` will give you the latest 8.3.x version)
- Patch Version (example: `8.3.2` will always stay at the 8.3.2 version)

If you use `latest`, you will always get the latest stable version of the CLI variation of PHP running the latest version of Debian. For the best stability in production environments, you may want to pin to a specific patch version (example: `8.3.2`).

### Few examples

::code-panel

```
::

In this example, we can lock into the `v3.0.0` release of our image. This is useful if you want to ensure there are no automatic changes that could break your CI process. [View our releases ‚Üí](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/releases)

## Viewing all available images & tags
All our images are available on DockerHub and GitHub Packages (ghcr.io). You can use their built-in search functions to browse through our entire collection of Docker Images:

- [View on GitHub Packages ‚Üí](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php)

## Downloading an image
In the simplest form of using the image, you can simply pull it down.

::code-panel
---
label: Pull an image with Docker
---
```bash
docker pull serversideup/php:8.3-fpm-nginx
```
::

If you'd like to explore the image a little bit more, you can run `bash` on the image and view the structure of everything.
